### purpose
Todayâ€™s teens are overwhelmed with work, yet arenâ€™t that great at managing their time to get work done effectively and efficiently. There are so many commitments they need to balance among school work, sports, clubs, extracurriculars, and it doesnâ€™t even leave room for all the distractions they face in their life. As a result, they often lose track of time and end up procrastinating until the last minute, piling up work without even realizing it.

### goal
Blossom aims to help people manage their time better and leave space to pursue other endeavors in their spare time. Our main goal is to allow users to schedule their time more efficiently in order to get the most out of their daily routines.Our project focuses on teenagers, but can impact any person who needs a simple method to manage their time.

### how it works
Through our application, users will be able to easily input their tasks and goals, which will then be converted into a schedule for users to use. Blossom will take in feedback to ensure the schedule is best fit to the userâ€™s preferences. Blossomâ€™s main goal is to calculate an efficient schedule based off of the userâ€™s input and itâ€™s default weighting system. However, as the user continues to give more feedback to the function, the program improves its weighting system to create the best possible schedule and continues doing so until the reward is maximized, creating a schedule perfectly adapted to the userâ€™s preferences just by learning from its own experience
